Created a Morse Code Detection system on a Raspberry Pi environment, using breadboard setup with a push-button for input and a 7-segment display for output. These inputs are processed by a program written in ARM assembly language running on the Raspberry Pi. The Morse code is decoded in real-time and displayed on the 7-segment display, providing an interactive way to visualize Morse code communication.
